### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fadel Bayloun
#### Software Engineer

I am a Software Engineer.  My main duty is to build scalable software to boost the development of my environment. I always make sure my code is readable, maintainable and resource-efficient whatever technology I'm using. In addition, I tend to ground through other stuff such as socializing and swimming.

Skills: Spring Boot / PHP/ React / HTML / CSS
