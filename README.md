### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fadel from Lebanon, a Freelance Web Developer. Essentially, my main duty is to build scalable software to boost the development of my environment. I always make sure my code is readable, maintainable and resource-efficient whatever technology I'm using. Plus, I tend to ground through other stuff such as socializing and swimming.
